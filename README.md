## Introduction

Customer churn refers to the phenomenon where customers stop using a company's products or services. Predicting churn helps businesses understand customer behavior and implement proactive retention strategies. This project uses machine learning models to predict customer churn based on historical data.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains information about customers, their services subscribed, and whether they churned or not. Key features include customer demographics, service details, and tenure with the company.

## Methods and Techniques

- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.
- **Modeling**: Using logistic regression, random forest classifier, and other ensemble methods for churn prediction.
- **Evaluation**: Assessing model performance using metrics such as accuracy, ROC curves, precision-recall curves, and confusion matrices.

## Implementation

The implementation involves:

- Exploratory data analysis to understand the dataset.
- Preprocessing steps including feature engineering and scaling.
- Training machine learning models on the processed data.
- Evaluating model performance using cross-validation and test set metrics.

## Results

- **Model Performance**: Detailed analysis of each model's performance metrics.
- **Visualizations**: ROC curves, precision-recall curves, and confusion matrices to visualize and interpret results.

## Conclusion

Customer churn prediction is a critical task for businesses to maintain customer satisfaction and revenue. This project demonstrates effective use of machine learning techniques to predict and analyze customer churn, providing insights for proactive customer retention strategies.

## Future Work

Future enhancements could include:

- Feature engineering for improved model performance.
- Exploring advanced machine learning algorithms.
- Deployment of a predictive model for real-time churn prediction.
